# Etch a Sketch - rainbow "snake-like" drawing board

My version of one of the exercises in [Wes Bos' Beginner JavaScript course](https://beginnerjavascript.com/).

## Features

- Use your keyboard arrows or the provided buttons to start drawing.
- Click on the "Shake!" button to clear the drawing board.

## Things I learned

This exercise was an opportunity to play around with:

- The [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)!
- The HSL color format
